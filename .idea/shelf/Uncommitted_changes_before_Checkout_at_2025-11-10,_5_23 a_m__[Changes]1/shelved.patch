+
+## 3. Design Vision
+
+### "A Green Sanctuary in Dark Space"
+
+**Emotional Journey:**
+- Visitors arrive in **cold, dark space** (uncertainty, vastness, fear)
+- They discover your **green, lush planet** (safety, warmth, home)
+- As they scroll, they transition from darkness → nature → comfort
+- Each section is a different biome of your world
+
+**Thematic Mapping:**
+- **Hero:** Enter orbit through dark space - discover the green oasis
+- **About:** Landing on the lush surface - getting to know the sanctuary
+- **Projects:** Exploring different biomes (forests, oceans, mountains)
+- **Blog:** Observatory/garden - thoughts, discoveries, and growth
+- **Bookshelf:** Library - seeds of knowledge from other worlds
+- **Contact:** Warm launch pad - where connections begin
+
+### Interactive Globe Hero (Inspired by Quanta Magazine)
+
+**3D Globe Features:**
+- Lush green continents with blue oceans (not dark - YOUR sanctuary!)
+- Rotatable with mouse/touch
+- Dark space background with parallax stars
+- Atmospheric glow around planet edges
+- Warm light source creating day/night
+
+**Navigation Pins (Color-Coded):**
+- 🌲 **Projects** - Green (forest biome)
+- 📝 **Blog** - Blue (observatory/garden)
+- 📚 **Bookshelf** - Teal (library)
+- 👤 **About** - Amber (landing site)
+- 📧 **Contact** - Gold (launch pad)
+
+**Fallbacks:**
+- Mobile: Static planet with clickable pins
+- Reduced motion: Non-rotating globe
+- Progressive enhancement: 2D → 3D
+
+### Visual Design Elements
+
+**Space Layer (Top/Outer):**
+- Parallax scrolling stars
+- Dark nebula clouds drifting
+- Constellation patterns
+- Interactive particles (react to mouse)
+
+**Planet Layer (Inner/Scrolled):**
+- Lush green surface textures
+- Ocean waves, forest canopy, mountain silhouettes
+- Floating leaves/nature particles
+- Warm atmospheric glows
+- Subtle animations (wind, water ripples)
+
+**Interaction Patterns:**
+- Smooth parallax scrolling creates depth
+- Scroll-triggered animations reveal sections
+- Hover effects respond to exploration
+- Cinematic transitions between sections
+
+### Color Palette
+
+**Space Colors (The Uncertain World):**
+- Deep blacks: `#0a0a0f`, `#111117`
+- Dark navy blues: `#0d1b2a`, `#1b263b`
+- Subtle purples: `#1a1a2e`, `#16213e`
+
+**Planet Colors (My Sanctuary):**
+- **Greens (Life):** `#2d6a4f`, `#40916c`, `#52b788`, `#74c69d`, `#95d5b2`
+- **Blues (Calm):** `#0077b6`, `#00b4d8`, `#48cae4`, `#90e0ef`, `#ade8f4`
+- **Warm (Energy):** `#f77f00`, `#fcbf49`, `#eae2b7`, `#ffb4a2`, `#e5989b`
+
+**Text Colors:**
+- On dark: Soft whites `#f8f9fa`, `#e9ecef`
+- Secondary: Muted grays `#adb5bd`, `#ced4da`
+- On light: Deep charcoal `#212529`, `#343a40`
+
+**Gradients:**
+- Dark space → planet atmosphere (dark blue → teal → green)
+- Sunrise on planet (deep purple → amber → gold)
+- Nature transitions (forest green → ocean blue)
+
+**Usage:**
+- Hero: Start in dark space, transition to planet colors
+- Scroll down: Gradually introduce more greens and warmth
+- Projects: Each project is a "biome" with palette colors
+- Blog: Observatory blues and greens
+- Contact: Warm launch pad with amber/gold

+
+## 4. Technical Stack
+
+**Framework:** Astro 4.0+
+- Ships **zero JavaScript by default** - optimal performance
+- **Islands architecture** - static content stays static, only globe is interactive
+- Built-in MDX support for blog
+- Excellent SEO with static site generation
+- Framework agnostic (can use React only where needed)
+- Built-in image optimization
+- Deploy anywhere (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare)
+
+**3D Globe (React Island):**
+- **React Three Fiber** - Declarative 3D with React (only loaded for globe)
+- **Three.js** - WebGL 3D graphics engine
+- **@react-three/drei** - Helpers (OrbitControls, etc.)
+- **react-globe.gl** - Pre-built globe component (evaluate vs custom)
+
+**Animation & Styling:**
+- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
+- **GSAP ScrollTrigger** - Lightweight parallax effects
+- **Framer Motion** (optional) - Page transitions if needed
+- CSS animations for simple effects
+
+**Content:**
+- **MDX** - Blog posts in Markdown with components (built into Astro)
+- Frontmatter for metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)
+- Content collections for type-safe content
+
+**Other:**
+- TypeScript
+- ESLint + Prettier
+- Vercel/Netlify Analytics (privacy-friendly)
+
+**Why This Stack:**
+
+1. **Performance First** - Astro ships minimal JS, perfect for "wow" first impression
+2. **Islands Architecture** - Only the 3D globe needs heavy JS, everything else is static HTML
+3. **Content-Heavy Site** - Blog, projects, bookshelf are all static content (Astro's strength)
+4. **Mobile Performance** - 54% of traffic is mobile, Astro excels here
+5. **SEO** - Static generation with no client-side routing overhead
+6. **Future-Proof** - Can add serverless functions or backend later if needed
+7. **Simplicity** - No backend complexity we don't need
+
+**Architecture:**
+```
+Astro (base)
+├── Static Pages: About, Projects, Blog, Bookshelf, Contact (zero JS)
+├── 3D Globe: React island with Three.js (only this loads JS)
+├── Parallax: GSAP for scroll effects (minimal JS)
+└── Content: MDX files for blog posts
+```
+
+**Technical Implementation Notes:**
+- Globe as client-only React island (`client:load` or `client:visible`)
+- Custom green/blue planet texture mapping
+- Pin markers: 3D objects or HTML overlays on globe
+- OrbitControls for rotation, raycasting for pin clicks
+- Level-of-detail optimization for mobile
+- Lazy load 3D assets for performance
+- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
+- Dark mode default (space theme), light mode = daytime planet
+- No backend needed - use services (Formspree for contact, etc.)
+

+
+## 5. Content Guidelines
+
+### Tone & Voice
+- Authentic and genuine
+- Professional but personable
+- Clear and accessible
+- Hints of playfulness
+
+### Content Philosophy
+- Focus on storytelling, not just listing achievements
+- Each project is a "landmark" on my planet
+- Blog posts are "transmissions" or "discoveries"
+- Show personality through content and design
+- Make it memorable - visitors want to return
+
+### Stories to Tell
+- My journey as a developer
+- Projects I've built and why
+- Things I've learned
+- Personal interests (fitness, psychology, tech)
+- Experiences and insights
+
+---
+
+## 6. Design Research
+
+**Inspiration Sites:**
+- ✓ [Skyroot.in](https://www.skyroot.in/) - Parallax, space theme, depth, smooth animations
+- ✓ [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-we-came-to-know-earth-20250915/) - Interactive 3D globe with pins
+
+**Still Need:**
+- [ ] 3-5 more portfolio/space-themed sites for inspiration
+- [ ] Typography examples (modern, readable, warm)
+- [ ] Create mood board with nature + space aesthetics
+
+---
+

+
+---
+
+## 8. Third-Party Services (No Backend Needed)
+
+Instead of building backend features, we'll use these services:
+
+- **Contact Form:** Formspree or Netlify Forms (free tier)
+- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics or Netlify Analytics (privacy-friendly)
+- **Newsletter:** ConvertKit or Buttondown (if/when needed)
+- **Comments:** None initially (keeping it simple)
+- **Hosting:** Vercel or Netlify (both have generous free tiers)
+- **Domain:** joonkim.dev (already owned)
+
+**Future options if needed:**
+- Serverless functions (Astro supports them)
+- Supabase/Firebase for database (if complexity grows)
+- Can always migrate specific features later
+
+---
+
+## 9. Open Questions
+
+1. **Domain:** Keep joonkim.dev or change?
+2. **Content:** Which projects to feature first?
+3. **Writing:** What blog topics initially?
+4. **Typography:** Which fonts for modern/warm feel?
+5. **Globe Texture:** Custom design or use existing Earth texture as base?
+6. **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify? (both work great with Astro)
+
+---
+
+## 10. Notes
+
+- Consider adding "Uses" page (tools/setup)
+- Consider "Now" page (what I'm currently doing)
+- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers, reduced motion)
+- Preload critical assets (globe texture, fonts)
+- Test on slow connections
+- Add loading states for 3D globe
